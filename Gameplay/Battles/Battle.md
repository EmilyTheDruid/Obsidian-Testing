Battle is on 2 3x3 grids, one for players, one for enemies

more of a final fantasy 7 type system
each person's speed relates to the # of ticks they need to do an action

on their turn they can:
Move once, to any square on their side (unless a special item/ability says otherwise)
[[Attack]]
try to flee

enemies can do the same on their turn
