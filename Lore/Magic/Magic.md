 4 main specs:

 [[Star]],[[Space]],[[Black hole]],[[Planet]]

 danger specs:

 [[Time]]: can destroy planets and whatnot, a castle is exploding in reverse in the stars

 [[Emotion]]: can manipulate humans

people that can do magic usually fall into one of the 4 main specs, they are innate and not born, very few are pure breeds, most have a combination of magic they can use

Crystals can be formed of all types of magic, they form where abundant amounts of magical energies are (stars, blackholes, center of nebulas, deep in crusts of planets)


 Time: temporal shielding/ travel

 Emotion:no clue
