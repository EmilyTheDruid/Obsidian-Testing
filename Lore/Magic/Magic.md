 ## What Magic is

people that can do magic usually fall into one of the 4 main specs, they are innate and not born, very few are pure breeds, most have a combination of magic they can use

Crystals can be formed of all types of magic, they form where abundant amounts of magical energies are (stars, blackholes, center of nebulas, deep in crusts of planets)

 tier system:

 space          planet           star           black hole 
 
 weaker                                                 stronger                                        
 common                                                      rare

 Time magic is rarer than black hole, usually self replicating as time travel leads to more time travel

 Emotion magic is the rarest, almost never being seen
