Door to [[The Vault]]
The door of the vault is made of stone, and has an inscription on the front that, when enough sun power is blasted into it, opens the vault, allowing contents to be put in/taken out of it, the door is embedded in a crystaline wall, with a flat area in front of it where [[The Fight]] Took place
