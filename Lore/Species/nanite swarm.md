Swarms of microscopic robots, each swarm has a core, nanites can't self reproduce, instead pools of nanites are manufactured so swarms of them are created and stored in vats on their ships so that any swarm core can add more to its hoard

originally created by [[Human]]s, a virus infected them and caused sentience, leading to them declaring independence, and taking over all nanite factories, before building a home for themselves in space
