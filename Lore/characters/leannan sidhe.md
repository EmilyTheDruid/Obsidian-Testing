Magic: [[Emotion]]

managed to corrupt the [[Princess]] with her magic, before she sealed herself in the vault. after the fight that took the emperor out of commission she vanished. She has stopped being a human and started becoming a force, when one host dies she uses her magic to transfer herself into a new host. She tried this spell with the princess but the princess was able to stop her just barely, parts of her still live within the princess though.
